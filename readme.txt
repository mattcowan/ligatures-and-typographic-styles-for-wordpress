== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need special fonts? =

Yes, this plugin requires fonts that support OpenType features. Most premium script fonts and professional typefaces include these features. Free fonts may have limited support.

= Will this work with any font? =

The plugin will work with any font, but you'll only see results if the font includes the OpenType features you're trying to use. Check your font's documentation for supported features.

= Does this work with Google Fonts? =

Some Google Fonts support OpenType features. Check the individual font's specimen page for feature support.

= Can I use this with custom web fonts? =

Absolutely! Load your fonts using @font-face in your theme or use a font plugin, then apply features with this plugin.

= Is this compatible with page builders? =

This plugin is designed for the WordPress block editor (Gutenberg). Compatibility with page builders depends on their implementation of rich text formatting.

= Will this slow down my site? =

No. The plugin uses CSS font-feature-settings which is a native browser capability. There's no JavaScript on the frontend.

= Can I apply features to body text? =

Currently, the plugin focuses on heading blocks (H1-H6). Support for other blocks may be added in future versions.

= How do I know which features my font supports? =

Check your font's documentation, or use the plugin to experiment. Features that aren't supported simply won't affect the text.
